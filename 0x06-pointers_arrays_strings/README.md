# C - Even More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This project builds on the basic concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. It is designed to help you further understand and practice working with pointers, memory, and string manipulation without using the standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, and `strlen`. The focus is on manipulating data directly through pointers and memory management.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to work with multidimensional arrays.
- Learn about pointers to pointers and how to manipulate them.
- Master string manipulation techniques without relying on the standard string functions.
- Develop a deeper understanding of memory management in C.

## Tasks

### 0. memset
Function that fills memory with a constant byte.

### 1. memcpy
Function that copies memory area.

### 2. strchr
Function that locates a character in a string.

### 3. strspn
Function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

### 4. strpbrk
Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

### 5. strstr
Function that locates a substring in a string.

### 6. Chess is mental torture
Function that converts a string to an integer.

### 7. Itâ€™s not what you think
Function that prints a string in reverse.
