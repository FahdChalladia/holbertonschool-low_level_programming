# C - Variadic Functions

This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the concept of variadic functions in C programming. It covers various implementations of variadic functions, including handling a variable number of arguments, printing different types of data, and processing them efficiently using macros like va_start, va_arg, and va_end.


---

**Tasks** - Each task is an individual C file that implements a function or nested loop operation.
    - 0-sum_them_all.c: Function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
    - 1-print_numbers.c: Function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
    - 2-print_strings.c: Function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
    - 3-print_all.c: Function that prints any type of data (char, int, float, string) based on a format string.
