# C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This project covers the basic concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. The tasks in this repository are designed to help understand and practice working with pointers, memory, and string manipulation without using the standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, and `strlen`. The functions focus on manipulating data directly through pointers.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and use pointers and arrays in C.
- Differentiate between pointers and arrays.
- Manipulate strings without using the standard string functions.
- Manage variable scope in C.

## Tasks

### 0. 98 Battery st.
Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
Function that swaps the values of two integers.

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
Function that returns the length of a string.

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
Function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
Function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes
Function that reverses a string.

### 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true
Function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
Function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

### 8. Arrays are not pointers
Function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### 9. strcpy
Function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

### 10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers
Function that converts a string to an integer.
