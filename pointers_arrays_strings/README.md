# C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This project delves deeper into the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. It is designed to help understand the more advanced uses of pointers and string manipulation, while also reinforcing the principles of memory management and variable scope in C.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and manipulate arrays and strings using pointers.
- Work with string concatenation and comparison functions.
- Handle memory using pointer arithmetic.
- Develop functions to manipulate and modify string data in various ways.
- Use arrays for different types of data and manage them effectively in C.
