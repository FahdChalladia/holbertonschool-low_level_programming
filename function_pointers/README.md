# C - Function pointers

This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the concept of function pointers in C programming. It covers various implementations of function pointers, including their use in callbacks, passing functions as arguments, and dynamic function selection, to help solidify the understanding of advanced function handling in C.

---

**Tasks** - Each task is an individual C file that implements a function or nested loop operation.
    - `0-print_name.c`: Function that prints a name.
    - `1-array_iterator.c`: Function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
    - `2-int_index.c`: Function that searches for an integer.
    - `3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h`: Program that performs simple operations.(+,-,*,/,%)
