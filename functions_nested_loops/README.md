# C - Functions, Nested Loops

This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the concept of functions and nested loops in C programming. It covers various function implementations and looping techniques to help solidify the understanding of structured programming.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each file implements a specific task related to functions or nested loops.

### Files

Each file implements a specific task related to functions or nested loops.

- `putchar.c`: 
  Function that prints a character.

- `1-print_alphabet.c`: 
  Function that prints the alphabet in lowercase.

- `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: 
  Function that prints the alphabet 10 times.

- `3-islower.c`: 
  Function that checks for a lowercase character.

- `4-isalpha.c`: 
  Function that checks for an alphabetic character.

- `5-print_sign.c`: 
  Function that prints the sign of a number.

- `6-abs.c`:

- `7-print_last_digit.c`: 
  Function that prints the last digit of a number.

- `8-jack_bauer.c`: 
  Function that prints every minute of the day.

- `9-times_table.c`: 
  Function that prints the 9 times table.

- `10-add.c`:
