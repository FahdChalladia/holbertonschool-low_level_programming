# C - Functions, Nested Loops

This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the concept of functions and nested loops in C programming. It covers various function implementations and looping techniques to help solidify the understanding of structured programming.

### Table of Contents
1. **General Concepts** - Overview of functions, nested loops, and their applications.
2. **Tasks** - Each task is an individual C file that implements a function or nested loop operation.
    - `putchar.c`: Function that prints a character.
    - `print_alphabet.c`: Function that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
    - `print_alphabet_x10.c`: Function that prints the alphabet 10 times.
    - `islower.c`: Function that checks for a lowercase character.
    - `isalpha.c`: Function that checks for an alphabetic character.
    - `print_sign.c`: Function that prints the sign of a number.
    - `abs.c`: Function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
    - `print_last_digit.c`: Function that prints the last digit of a number.
    - `jack_bauer.c`: Function that prints every minute of the day.
    - `times_table.c`: Function that prints the 9 times table.
    - `add.c`: Function that adds two integers and returns the result.
    - `print_to_98.c`: Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98.

### General:

#### What are Functions?
A function in C is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions improve code readability, reusability, and modularity.

#### How to Implement Functions
1. **Function Declaration**: Specifies the functionâ€™s name, return type, and parameters.
2. **Function Definition**: Contains the actual code that runs when the function is called.
3. **Function Call**: Executes the function by passing necessary arguments.

#### What are Nested Loops?
A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. It is commonly used for multi-dimensional problems such as matrices and pattern printing.

#### When to Use Functions and Nested Loops
- **Functions**: When a task needs to be reused multiple times within the program.
- **Nested Loops**: When dealing with multi-level iterations like tables, grids, and multi-dimensional arrays.

#### Common GCC Flags
- `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`: Enables warnings and ensures compliance with the GNU89 standard.
