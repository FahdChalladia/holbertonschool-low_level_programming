# C - argc, argv

This project is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on understanding and using command-line arguments (`argc` and `argv`) in C programs.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each file implements a specific task related to command-line arguments.

### Files

- `0-whatsmyname.c`
  Prints the name of the program itself.

- `1-args.c`
  Prints the total number of arguments passed to the program.

- `2-args.c`
  Prints all arguments received by the program, one per line.

- `3-mul.c`
  Multiplies two numbers passed as arguments and prints the result. Includes error handling for incorrect argument count.

- `4-add.c`
  Adds positive numbers passed as arguments and prints the result. Includes error handling for non-digit inputs and prints 0 if no numbers are passed.
