# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project introduces the basic concepts of variables, conditionals, and loops in the C programming language. The tasks are designed to help you understand fundamental concepts like arithmetic operators, logical operators, relational operators, and using loops to control program flow.

### Table of Contents
1. **General Concepts** - Overview of variables, if-else statements, and while loops in C.
2. **Tasks** - Each task is an individual C file that implements basic concepts and helps you get familiar with C programming syntax and logic.
    - `0-positive_or_negative.c`: Checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
    - `1-last_digit.c`: Prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and categorizes it.
    - `2-print_alphabet.c`: Prints the lowercase alphabet using the `putchar` function.
    - `3-print_alphabets.c`: Prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets.
    - `4-print_alphabt.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase except for 'q' and 'e'.
    - `5-print_numbers.c`: Prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9.
    - `6-print_numberz.c`: Prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 without using any char variables.
    - `7-print_tebahpla.c`: Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.
    - `8-print_base16.c`: Prints all numbers in base 16 (hexadecimal).
    - `9-print_comb.c`: Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

### General:

#### What You Will Learn:
- **Variables**: How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`, and assign values.
- **Operators**: Understanding arithmetic, logical, and relational operators in C.
- **Conditionals**: How to use `if`, `if...else` statements to make decisions in your programs.
- **Loops**: Using `while` loops to repeat actions until a condition is met.
- **Printing**: Printing values of variables using `putchar` and `printf`.
- **ASCII**: Understanding how the ASCII character set works in C.
- **GCC Flags**: The purpose of the `-m32` and `-m64` flags when compiling C programs.

### Tasks:

0. `0-positive_or_negative.c`
    - **Description**: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints whether `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

1. `1-last_digit.c`
    - **Description**: This program prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n` and categorizes it (greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 but not 0).

2. `2-print_alphabet.c`
    - **Description**: Prints the alphabet in lowercase using only the `putchar` function.

3. `3-print_alphabets.c`
    - **Description**: Prints the alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase using only the `putchar` function.

4. `4-print_alphabt.c`
    - **Description**: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

5. `5-print_numbers.c`
    - **Description**: Prints all single-digit numbers from 0 to 9.

6. `6-print_numberz.c`
    - **Description**: Prints all single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 using only the `putchar` function, without using `char` variables.

7. `7-print_tebahpla.c`
    - **Description**: Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using only the `putchar` function.

8. `8-print_base16.c`
    - **Description**: Prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase (from 0 to f).

9. `9-print_comb.c`
    - **Description**: Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers (0 to 9) separated by commas and spaces.

### Requirements:

- **General:**
    - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
    - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
    - All your files should end with a new line.
    - A `README.md` file should be at the root of the folder for the project.
    - No errors or warnings should be present during compilation.
    - You are **not allowed** to use `system`.
    - Your code should follow the **Betty style** and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
