# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project introduces the basic concepts of variables, conditionals, and loops in the C programming language. The tasks are designed to help you understand fundamental concepts like arithmetic operators, logical operators, relational operators, and using loops to control program flow.

### Files

Each task is an individual C file that implements basic concepts and helps you get familiar with C programming syntax and logic.

- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: 
  Checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

- `1-last_digit.c`: 
  Prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and categorizes it.

- `2-print_alphabet.c`: 
  Prints the lowercase alphabet using the `putchar` function.

- `3-print_alphabets.c`: 
  Prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets.

- `4-print_alphabt.c`: 
  Prints the alphabet in lowercase except for 'q' and 'e'.

- `5-print_numbers.c`: 
  Prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9.

- `6-print_numberz.c`: 
  Prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 without using any char variables.

- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: 
  Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

- `8-print_base16.c`: 
  Prints all numbers in base 16 (hexadecimal).

- `9-print_comb.c`: 
  Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
