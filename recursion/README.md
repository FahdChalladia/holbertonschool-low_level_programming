# C - Recursion
This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the concept of recursion in C programming. It covers various recursive functions to help solidify the understanding of recursion in problem-solving.

#### What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It breaks down complex problems into more manageable sub-problems.

#### How to Implement Recursion
1. **Base Case**: Define the condition that stops the recursion.
2. **Recursive Case**: Modify the problem so that the function moves closer to the base case with each call.

#### When to Implement Recursion
- **Hierarchical Data Structures**: Trees and graphs.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Problems like sorting and searching.
- **Mathematical Sequences**: Factorial, Fibonacci, etc.

#### When Not to Implement Recursion
- **Memory Issues**: If recursion depth could be very large and lead to stack overflow.
- **Performance**: When an iterative solution would be more efficient.

### Files 

Each task is an individual C file that implements a recursive function.

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: 
  Function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: 
  Function that prints a string in reverse.

- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: 
  Function that returns the length of a string.

- `3-factorial.c`: 
  Function that returns the factorial of a given number.

- `4-pow_recursion.c`: 
  Function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.

- `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: 
  Function that returns the natural square root of a number.

- `6-is_prime_number.c`: 
  Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise returns 0.
