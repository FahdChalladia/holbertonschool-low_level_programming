# C - Recursion
This repository contains several tasks demonstrating the concept of recursion in C programming. It covers various recursive functions to help solidify the understanding of recursion in problem-solving.

### Table of Contents
1. **General Concepts** - Overview of recursion, its implementation, and usage.
2. **Tasks** 

Each task is an individual C file that implements a recursive function.

- `puts_recursion.c`: 
  Function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

- `print_rev_recursion.c`: 
  Function that prints a string in reverse.

- `strlen_recursion.c`: 
  Function that returns the length of a string.

- `factorial.c`: 
  Function that returns the factorial of a given number.

- `pow_recursion.c`: 
  Function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.

- `sqrt_recursion.c`: 
  Function that returns the natural square root of a number.

- `is_prime_number.c`: 
  Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise returns 0.

### General:

#### What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It breaks down complex problems into more manageable sub-problems.

#### How to Implement Recursion
1. **Base Case**: Define the condition that stops the recursion.
2. **Recursive Case**: Modify the problem so that the function moves closer to the base case with each call.

#### When to Implement Recursion
- **Hierarchical Data Structures**: Trees and graphs.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Problems like sorting and searching.
- **Mathematical Sequences**: Factorial, Fibonacci, etc.

#### When Not to Implement Recursion
- **Memory Issues**: If recursion depth could be very large and lead to stack overflow.
- **Performance**: When an iterative solution would be more efficient.
