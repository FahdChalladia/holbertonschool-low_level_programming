# C - Hello, World

This repository contains several tasks that introduce the basic concepts of C programming, with a focus on the foundational "Hello, World!" program and understanding the C programming structure. It includes various tasks that help demonstrate essential programming concepts, including preprocessor, compiler, and basic I/O operations.

### General:

#### What is C Programming?

C programming is a structured, procedural programming language used to develop software applications and systems. It is known for its efficiency and control over hardware resources.

#### How to Compile a C Program

1. **Preprocessor**: Runs macro substitution, file inclusion, and other tasks before actual compilation.
2. **Compiler**: Translates the code to assembly language.
3. **Assembler**: Converts assembly code into machine code (object files).
4. **Linker**: Links the object files to create an executable.

#### When to Use C Programming

- **System Programming**: Operating systems, compilers, and other low-level applications.
- **Embedded Systems**: Programming microcontrollers and hardware.
- **High-Performance Applications**: Where efficiency and speed are crucial.

### Files 

Each task is an individual C file that implements basic functions and introduces you to the foundational structure of a C program.

- `0-preprocessor.c`: 
  Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result.

- `1-compiler.c`: 
  Script that compiles a C file without linking.

- `2-assembler.c`: 
  Script that generates the assembly code of a C program.

- `3-name.c`: 
  Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

- `4-puts.c`: 
  C program that prints a string using the `puts` function.

- `5-printf.c`: 
  C program that prints a string using the `printf` function.

- `6-size.c`: 
  C program that prints the size of various types on the system it is compiled on.
