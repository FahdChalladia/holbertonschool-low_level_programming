# C - Hello, World

This repository contains several tasks that introduce the basic concepts of C programming, with a focus on the foundational "Hello, World!" program and understanding the C programming structure. It includes various tasks that help demonstrate essential programming concepts, including preprocessor, compiler, and basic I/O operations.

### Table of Contents
1. **General Concepts** - Overview of C programming, its compilation, and structure.
2. **Tasks** - Each task is an individual C file that implements basic functions and introduces you to the foundational structure of a C program.
    - `0-preprocessor.c`: Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result.
    - `1-compiler.c`: Script that compiles a C file without linking.
    - `2-assembler.c`: Script that generates the assembly code of a C program.
    - `3-name.c`: Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
    - `4-puts.c`: C program that prints a string using the `puts` function.
    - `5-printf.c`: C program that prints a string using the `printf` function.
    - `6-size.c`: C program that prints the size of various types on the system it is compiled on.

### General:

#### What is C Programming?
C programming is a structured, procedural programming language used to develop software applications and systems. It is known for its efficiency and control over hardware resources.

#### How to Compile a C Program
1. **Preprocessor**: Runs macro substitution, file inclusion, and other tasks before actual compilation.
2. **Compiler**: Translates the code to assembly language.
3. **Assembler**: Converts assembly code into machine code (object files).
4. **Linker**: Links the object files to create an executable.

#### When to Use C Programming
- **System Programming**: Operating systems, compilers, and other low-level applications.
- **Embedded Systems**: Programming microcontrollers and hardware.
- **High-Performance Applications**: Where efficiency and speed are crucial.

### Tasks:

0. `0-preprocessor.c`
    - **Description**: Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into a new file.
    
1. `1-compiler.c`
    - **Description**: Script that compiles a C file without linking, generating a `.o` object file.
    
2. `2-assembler.c`
    - **Description**: Script that generates the assembly code from a C file and saves it in a `.s` file.
    
3. `3-name.c`
    - **Description**: Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
    
4. `4-puts.c`
    - **Description**: C program that prints a string using the `puts` function.
    
5. `5-printf.c`
    - **Description**: C program that prints a string using the `printf` function.
    
6. `6-size.c`
    - **Description**: C program that prints the size of various types (e.g., char, int, long) on the system it is compiled on.
