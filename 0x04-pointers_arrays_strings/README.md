# C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This project delves deeper into the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. It is designed to help understand the more advanced uses of pointers and string manipulation, while also reinforcing the principles of memory management and variable scope in C.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and manipulate arrays and strings using pointers.
- Work with string concatenation and comparison functions.
- Handle memory using pointer arithmetic.
- Develop functions to manipulate and modify string data in various ways.
- Use arrays for different types of data and manage them effectively in C.

## Tasks

### 0. strcat
Function that concatenates two strings.

### 1. strncat
Function that concatenates two strings, but with a limit on the number of bytes used from the second string.

### 2. strncpy
Function that copies the string pointed to by `src` to the buffer pointed to by `dest`, with a specified maximum number of bytes.

### 3. strcmp
Function that compares two strings.

### 4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy
Function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

### 5. Always look up
Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

### 6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes
Function that capitalizes all words of a string.

### 7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody
Function that encodes a string into 1337.
